TODO

Make m4w::Camera use m4w::Pointer in constructor
Make UUIDMap return reference instead of Pointer
Generaelly make all Pointers that you can a Reference

VERTEXLAYOUT SHOULD ALWAYS BE APPLIED AFTER VERTEXBUFFER
Times this mistake was made: atleast 2

Check that there is no Cyclic reference, that stops Pointer from removing them


Old:
Figure out Pointers in VertexBuffer and IndexBuffer
Figure out thing were compiler does padding on structs
